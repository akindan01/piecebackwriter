      content: `Fade in, fade out.  
Five happy words, drowned and now lost.  
I pick up bricks of memory,  
trying to build a castle where the heart heals.  
One, two…  
Where is the missing piece?

A whispered promise,  
a climax of hope.  
The castle walls rise, stone by stone,  
the heart pounds as it goes, row by row.  
Shades of effort, echoes of light,  
but a space remains—  
a hollow that no stone fills.

I built to survive, not to feel.  
Stacked walls high enough  
to keep out the storm,  
but also the sun.  
I mistook silence for peace,  
control for healing,  
and still, the ache hums quietly beneath it all.

What I longed for was never out there—  
not in what I lost,  
but in what I buried:  
the softness, the surrender,  
the truth I was too tired to hold.

Some pieces don’t return—  
they wait.  
And when the heart is ready,  
not whole, but honest,  
they find their way back.  

Not as perfection.  
But as presence.`,

      excerpt: "Tears that fall like Autumn Rain...",
      content: `TEARS that fall like autumn rain,  
DEFINING the heart’s deep pain,  
SILENT drops that speak a thousand words,  
ECHOES of a sorrow that deepens every words.

TEARS that falls, tears that burns  
PUSHING out the fears,  
FLOWING out like a torrent, unimaginable things now reaveled.  
SO clear nothing seems so dear, oh worn and weary.

TEARS that falls, aches like sores,  
DEEP, deep and deep a drop feels like more,  
TEARS that fall, a love once lost,  
ECHOES of a heart that paid the cost.  
IN the shadows of memories, pain resides,  
A broken heart where sorrow hides.`,

BEAUTIFUL sparks of broken tides  
LINES that stronger abide  
SOUNDS of the cracks, oh love’s discharged.

DISCHARGED LOVE with in a soft heart solute  
DISSOLVED in the solvent of the broken tides of fragile pieces mending into a whole  
IN the depth of cracks, there love unfolds.

RESONANCE of sounds, vibrant movement of lines to the heart,  
FREQUENCIES of notes, melodious in heart,  
SIGHT of cracks, fascinating in sight,  
DISCHARGED LOVE, comforting pains in the heart.

BEYOND CRACKS, I find peace out of every lines and sounds.  
BEYOND CRACKS, the feeling of positivity is mapped.`,
